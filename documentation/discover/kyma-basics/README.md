# Discover the Basics of SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

Before you continue with this mission, we recommend knowing the basics on how to use Kyma in a single tenant application.

The mission [Getting Started with the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3252/3281/) provides a good overview on how to provision and configure systems in the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

You can also have a look at the [official Kyma documentation](https://kyma-project.io/#/), if you want to refresh your knowledge.
